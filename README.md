Pneumonia Detection Model helps in detecting pneumonia by using Xray images using Machine Learning,python ,CNN , Image Classification This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning model that detects pneumonia in chest X-ray images.

Project Overview

Goal: Develop a model to accurately classify chest X-ray images as either pneumonia or normal. Machine Learning Approach: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Python (version X.X or later) https://www.python.org/downloads/ Essential libraries (install using pip): TensorFlow https://www.tensorflow.org/ Keras https://keras.io/ NumPy https://numpy.org/ Matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/

Clone this repository:

Bash git clone https://<your_repository_link> Use code with caution. content_copy Set up the environment:

Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate dependencies: Bash python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows Use code with caution. content_copy Install the required libraries: Bash pip install -r requirements.txt # If you have a requirements.txt file Use code with caution. content_copy Data

The dataset used for training and validation is located in the data folder. The data should be organized into subfolders for each class (e.g., pneumonia, normal). [Optional] Explore data visualization tools like OpenCV (if installed) to get a sense of the data distribution. Model Training

Train the model:

Run the script train.py. This script performs the following steps: Loads the data. Preprocesses the images (e.g., resizing, normalization). Defines the CNN architecture (refer to the script for details). Compiles the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function. Trains the model on the training data. Evaluates the model's performance on the validation data. Saves the trained model weights. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):

Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, learning rate) in train.py to potentially improve model performance. Use techniques like grid search or random search for efficient exploration. Evaluation

The trained model's performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) will be displayed during training and saved to a file (e.g., training_history.json). You can further evaluate the model on a separate test set (not used for training or validation) to assess its generalizability. Model Usage (Optional)

If you plan to use the trained model for prediction on new chest X-ray images, create a separate script for inference. This script would load the trained model weights, preprocess the new image, and make a prediction about the presence of pneumonia.
